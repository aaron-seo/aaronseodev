<h1>Aaron Kyungmin Seo</h1>

<p>Hey! Welcome to my personal page.</p>

<p>I'm a Software Engineer, working at Amazon Leo, where I help secure communications from satellites to the ground.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy music (both listening and creating), movies, and working on silly projects like this one.</p>

<p>I might end up writing some blog posts here about random stuff... we'll see...</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

You can try reaching me at <a href="mailto:aaronkmseo@gmail.com">aaronkmseo@gmail.com</a>.

I'm starting to migrate to ProtonMail, though, so you might have better luck with <a href="mailto:aaronseo@protonmail.com">aaronseo@protonmail.com</a>.
